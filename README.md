## YouTube Summarizer

This Python Discord bot utilizes the power of Google's Gemini Pro model to summarize YouTube videos. Simply paste a YouTube link into the designated Discord channel (youtube-summarizer), and the bot will automatically fetch the video's transcript, analyze it, and generate a concise and insightful summary. The bot also provides a list of key participants, memorable quotes, and noteworthy questions and answers. The ask command allows you to further engage with the bot by posing specific questions based on the video's content.

## Podcast Summarizer

This Python Discord bot harnesses the capabilities of the Gemini Pro model to extract key insights from podcast episodes. Provide a podcast link in the designated Discord channel (podcaster-transcriber), and the bot will download the episode, analyze its audio content, and deliver a comprehensive summary. The summary includes details like participants, key takeaways, memorable quotes, and notable Q&A segments.


Additional Notes:

Both scripts utilize Vertex AI's Gemini Pro model for natural language understanding and content generation, leveraging the power of large language models to analyze and summarize audio content.
These bots can be valuable tools for anyone who wants to quickly understand the key takeaways of YouTube videos or podcast episodes, saving time and effort.
